<Steps>

### Create project

Start by creating a new Remix project using `create-remix`:

```bash
npx create-remix@latest my-app
```

### Run the CLI

Run the `shadcn-ui` init command to setup your project:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

### Configure components.json

You will be asked a few questions to configure `components.json`:

```txt showLineNumbers
Which style would you like to use? › Default
Which color would you like to use as base color? › Slate
Where is your global CSS file? › › app/tailwind.css
Do you want to use CSS variables for colors? › no / yes
Where is your tailwind.config.js located? › tailwind.config.js
Configure the import alias for components: › ~/components
Configure the import alias for utils: › ~/lib/utils
Are you using React Server Components? › no
```

### App structure

- Place the UI components in the `app/components/ui` folder.
- Your own components can be placed in the `app/components` folder.
- The `app/lib` folder contains all the utility functions. We have a `utils.ts` where I define the `cn` helper.
- The `app/tailwind.css` file contains the global CSS.

### Enable Tailwind and PostCSS

We have to install tailwindcss and autoprefixer.

```bash
pnpm add -D tailwindcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
```

Then we create a `postcss.config.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

And finally we add the following to our `remix.config.js` file:

```js {4-5}
/** @type {import('@remix-run/dev').AppConfig} */
module.exports = {
  ...
  tailwind: true,
  postcss: true,
  ...
};
```

### Include tailwind.css in your Remix app

In your `app/root.tsx` file, import the `tailwind.css` file:

```js {1, 4}
import styles from "./tailwind.css"

export const links: LinksFunction = () => [
  { rel: "stylesheet", href: styles },
  ...(cssBundleHref ? [{ rel: "stylesheet", href: cssBundleHref }] : []),
]
```

</Steps>
